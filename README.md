# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_SQL_MAVEN_MARKET_DATA

As part of my analysis of Maven Market data, I developed a structured SQL database to manage key retail information, including customers, products, stores, regions, transactions, and returns. Each table was designed with appropriate primary and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity and relational consistency. I imported data from a backup source after validation and prevented duplicates using conditional logic. I performed analytical queries to extract business insights such as total revenue, average product cost and weight, and store-wise sales. The project also identified top returned products to highlight quality or satisfaction issues. I analyzed customer income and membership data to explore purchasing behavior, while demographic segmentation helped understand market trends. Regional sales analysis provided insight into geographic performance. I used SQL techniques such as JOINs, GROUP BY, aggregation functions, and nested subqueries. This project strengthened my database design skills and query optimization techniques. It also enhanced my ability to interpret structured retail data. Overall, the project helped simulate real-world analytics and business decision-making through SQL.
